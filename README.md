# Stars
Project for stars about eclipsing binaries

To run you must have matplotlib and numpy

Run the testing.py and it will display shapes for you
Right now I don't have any stable testing file becuase I keep changing the inputs
When I standardize them I plan on having some sort of file that won't change much
